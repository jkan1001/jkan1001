Hello, I’m @jkan1001! I'm most interested in programming simulations and processing data using mathematical models in languages such as Python, but really
I'm interested in a lot of things, including games, web and app development, networking and cybersecurity. I can't say I'm particularly proficient in any
of these last 4 :p. I'm currently learning Matlab and refining my skills in Python, and I've been experimenting with the geopandas package in Python for GIS, 
as well as matplotlib and mayavi in Python for plotting data. I'm mostly self-taught so I'm willing to gain some baseline experience on smaller, simpler projects
otherwise independent of what they may entail.
